Objective: Create an application that allows users to register guests at a hotel.
﻿
You will have 48 hours to complete this assignment.
﻿
Application Components:

Database: Store information of users allowed to use the API services.

    REST API: Provide endpoints for user and guest management.

﻿
Guest Attributes:

Name
Surname
Date of Birth
Gender (M/F/X)
Passport Number
Country
User ID who registered the guest

    Registration ID

﻿
Registration Details:

List of guests
Check-in Date

    Check-out Date

Guest Registration Process (using REST API endpoints):

User Login: Users login using an email and password.
Submit Guests: Users submit a list of guests with check-in and check-out dates.

    Validation: Immediate feedback is provided based on validation rules.

﻿
Notes:

Data must be contextually validated for hotel guest registration.

    No frontend implementation is required, it is a REST API service so you must focus on the development of a solid API

Extra Features:

Email Notification: Implement an email system to notify users when a list of guests is submitted.
Rate Limiting: To prevent abuse, implement rate limiting on the API that limits submissions to a maximum of 5 per minute.
Webhook: Implement a webhook that, on every submission, sends the data to the following URL (https://webhook.site/e517553c-6fcb-4ade-9524-208e2d6c4068

    )

Technical Requirements:

Symfony (latest version)
MySQL

    Platform API

Deliverables:

GitHub Repository: Create a repository and provide access to
a.bonumore@emergento.com
.
Installation Instructions: Clear, step-by-step guide on how to install the application.

    Demonstration Video: A video demonstrating a client performing the guest registration process.

Evaluation Criteria:

Quality of Code: Ensure the implementation is basic yet well-structured.
Documentation: Provide comprehensive and clear documentation for easy verification in a local environment.

    Punctuality: Adhere to deadlines strictly; delays will not be tolerated.
